# Task-2

This project demonstrates how to build a dynamic HR dashboard in Tableau, covering steps from gathering user requirements, designing mockups, creating data sources, to developing visualizations and refining the dashboard.


The process of building a Tableau dashboard involves ensuring correct data types, exploring relationships within the data, and formatting initial worksheets for a consistent design, followed by analyzing user requirements to decide on chart types for the HR summary view.


The process involves defining project colors and fonts, setting up a dark theme for the dashboard, adjusting view settings, creating calculated fields for employee status, and implementing the first visualizations, such as displaying total hired, terminated, and active employees.


The process involves duplicating sheets to create visualizations for total active, terminated, and hired employees, followed by creating line charts to track trends over time and bar charts to display employee breakdowns by department and job titles.


The process involves creating visualizations to compare employee distribution by department, location, and city using bar charts for ranking, calculating HQ vs. branch locations, and designing a map to show employee distribution across states.


The process involves creating a detailed pie chart to display the gender ratio in the company, with adjustments for colors, labels, and percentages, and including a calculated field for reuse in future visualizations.


A heat map is created to visualize the correlation between age groups and education levels, with age groups calculated from birth dates and displayed alongside education levels to analyze employee distribution.


A heat map is created to analyze the correlation between education levels and performance ratings, revealing that higher education may improve performance, though other factors also play a role.


A purple chart reveals significant gender salary gaps at different education levels, while a scatter plot highlights correlations between age and salary across departments, with specific jobs showing high salaries despite non-managerial roles.


The process of planning and sketching a dashboard involves creating a mockup of the layout with sections for different data visualizations, using tools like PowerPoint or Procreate, followed by structuring the container elements in Tableau to ensure an organized and professional final design.


The dashboard structure is planned with containers for navigation, header, and charts, using vertical and horizontal containers to organize sections such as overview, demographics, and income, followed by implementation in Tableau with appropriate layout and sizing adjustments.


The dashboard layout is structured with containers for the header, overview, demographics, and income sections, using vertical and horizontal containers to organize titles, charts, and key performance indicators, followed by detailed placement of elements in Tableau.


The dashboard layout is structured with various vertical and horizontal containers for charts, KPIs, and titles, including demographic data like gender and education, with dividers separating sections and step-by-step placement of visual elements.


The dashboard is refined with background color adjustments, font resizing, and enhanced chart titles, followed by adding status indicators to department charts to show employment status.


The dashboard is further refined with color adjustments for employee status, added percentage labels for certain charts, and the highlighting of the highest values in various metrics for better visibility.


The dashboard layout is fine-tuned with added spacing between sections, removal of borders, and adjustment of inner and outer padding to improve readability and organization.


The layout and spacing of the dashboard are fine-tuned by adjusting the padding, divider widths, and chart sizes to ensure a balanced and professional presentation.


Tooltips are customized for each chart to display relevant data with dynamic color changes and percentages, and the dashboard is enhanced with a hierarchy-based approach for drill-down capabilities.


Tooltips are customized for different charts and hierarchies, adding detailed information such as job titles, states, and cities, with dynamic changes based on the user's interactions with the dashboard.


Various tooltips are customized for different charts, adding relevant details such as age, education level, gender, and salary, with careful attention to hierarchy and formatting to ensure accurate and professional results across the dashboard.


Filters are added to various charts for dynamic interactivity, allowing users to filter data by criteria such as gender, status, location, and hire date, with a show/hide button for filter visibility and consistent design across the dashboard.


A navigation system with icons is added to the dashboard for easy switching between different views, along with an info container that provides contextual details about the dashboard, including user tips and instructions.


The dashboard is enhanced with organized sections of navigation, export, info, and social media icons, each separated by dividers and labeled with small texts, offering users clear navigation and interaction options, including details about the data source and links to related profiles.


The dashboard layout is refined by adjusting icon sizes, adding separators, and organizing sections with proper spacing, followed by implementing an interactive employee details list with advanced techniques to display demographic information and facilitate filtering in Tableau.


The employee list is formatted with demographic, job, location, salary, status, and hire details, alongside customized design choices to ensure clarity and alignment, ultimately incorporating a bar chart to visualize employment duration.


The dashboard is designed by organizing employee information into detailed rows with filters, customizing containers and layouts for ease of navigation and efficient visualization of data.


The dashboard layout is refined by adding vertical and horizontal containers for filters and lists, with dynamic features such as a toggle button to show/hide filters and space optimization based on filter visibility.


The dashboard is enhanced by adding various dropdown filters, styling them with a consistent design, and ensuring dynamic flexibility by adjusting container heights and layout settings.


The dashboard design is finalized with improved spacing, added titles, and visual enhancements like active indicators and background customization using Figma for a professional look.


The dashboard design is enhanced with custom background images, improved visual elements, and final tweaks, leading to a polished, interactive, and professional-looking dashboard.
